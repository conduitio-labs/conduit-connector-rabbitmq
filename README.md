# Conduit Connector for RabbitMQ

The RabbitMQ connector is one of [Conduit](https://github.com/ConduitIO/conduit) standalone plugins. It provides both a source and a destination connector for [RabbitMQ](https://rabbitmq.com/).

It uses the [AMQP 0-9-1 Model](https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/amqp-concepts) to connect to RabbitMQ.

## What data does the OpenCDC record consist of?

| Field                   | Description                                                                               |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `record.Position`       | json object with the delivery tag and the queue name from where the record was read from. |
| `record.Operation`      | currently fixed as "create".                                                              |
| `record.Metadata`       | a string to string map, with keys prefixed as `rabbitmq.{DELIVERY_PROPERTY}`.             |
| `record.Key`            | the message id from the read message.                                                     |
| `record.Payload.Before` | <empty>                                                                                   |
| `record.Payload.After`  | the message body                                                                          |

## How to Build?

Run `make build` to compile the connector.

## Testing

Execute `make test` to perform all non-tls tests. Execute `make test-tls` for the TLS tests. Both commands use docker files located at `test/docker-compose.yml` and `test/docker-compose-tls.yml` respectively.
Tests require docker-compose v2.
